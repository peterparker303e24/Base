This project is currently built on the Ethereum testnet, Sepolia. This testnet does not require any payment since the Sepolia cryptocurrency can be freely accessed with faucets through websites such as in the link below. Also, a wallet browser extension is required, such as MetaMask, though this is also free to install.
